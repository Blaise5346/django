The project is a simple Django-based web application designed to manage and display questions and answers. Here's a brief overview:
Purpose: The application allows administrators to add, manage, and display questions and answers through the Django admin interface. It also provides a webpage for users to view these questions.
Key Components:
Models: The application uses Django models to define the structure of the data, including Category, Question, and Answer models.
Admin Interface: Administrators can add and manage questions and answers through the Django admin interface.
Views and Templates: The application includes views that handle HTTP requests and templates that display the questions and answers.
URLs: URLs are defined to map to the views, allowing users to access the questions webpage.
Functionality:
Admin: Administrators can log in to the admin interface to add, edit, and delete questions and answers.
User: Users can view the questions and answers on a dedicated webpage.
Architecture: The project follows the Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture, which is a variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This architecture separates the logic into models (data), views (request handlers), and templates (presentation layer).
This setup ensures that the application is scalable, secure, and maintainable, leveraging Django's built-in features for rapid development.
